# HMI Practical 4

## Create a user interface to sell products

- In this practical I have designed an application that could be used to sell smoothies online.
- It has a simple UI where a user can chose from a variety of assorted smoothies.
- Users can specify other requirements such as fruit toppings or straws and can proceed for payment.

The screens were developed using proto.io
